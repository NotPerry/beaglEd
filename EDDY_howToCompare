Eddy,

While I was going through making the first half, I found some things that may be helpful:

How to read from csv file into a dictionary:
csv.DictReader
https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv

How to find differences in two csv files:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38996033/python-compare-two-csv-files-and-print-out-differences/38996349

Another way to do it:
https://pypi.org/project/csv-diff/



We all code differently, so don't feel obligated to use them, just thought they could save you time!

V/r,
