#Need:
#   Filename with full path
#   Hash
#   date/time file was observed

#run and update the hash information, upon completion it should print out summary information that includes 
#   all new files found, 
#   any missing files, and 
#   any file that was modified.

#Extra Credit
#Goal: Detect that a file was moved
#Add to your summary section an output that documents 
#   where the file is now, and 
#   where it was, and 
#   the time of the last scan that saw it in the older location.
